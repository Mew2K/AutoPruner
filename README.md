## AutoPruner

This is a simple utility for automatically deleting empty chunks and chunk sections from minecraft 1.8 minigame maps.

## Usage

- `java -jar Autopruner-1.0.jar -d [path to directory with maps]`

## Notes

- Adapted NBT handling code from https://github.com/Querz/NBT and modified it to work for 1.8 worlds
